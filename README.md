DESCRIPTION
  kmtools - a collection of tools to process text-based k-mer matrices

USAGE
  kmtools <command> <arguments>

COMMANDS
  diff    - difference between two sorted k-mer matrices
  fasta   - output a k-mer matrix in FASTA format
  filter  - filter a k-mer matrix by selecting k-mers that are potentially differential
  merge   - merge two input sorted k-mer matrices
  reverse - reverse complement k-mers in a matrix
  select  - select only a subset of k-mers
  unitig  - build a unitig matrix
  version - print version
```

## Use case: construction of a unitig matrix with abundances

### Required tools

* [kmtricks](https://github.com/tlemane/kmtricks) to build k-mer matrices
* [GGCAT](https://github.com/algbio/ggcat) (or [BCALM2](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm)) to build unitigs

### 1. Build a k-mer matrix

Run `kmtricks pipeline` with an appropriate value of `--kmer-size` and `--hard-min`. Use parameter `--mode kmer:count:bin` to build a count matrix, `kmer:pa:bin` for a presence-absence matrix. 

Consider using the `--cpr` parameter to reduce space usage during computation.

### 2. Output a sorted text matrix

Merging and sorting kmtricks partitions can be done simply with the command `kmtricks aggregate` with parameters `--matrix kmer --format text --cpr-in --sorted`. By default, the output is printed on stdout, so you might want to use the `--output` parameter to output the sorted text matrix on a given file.

### 3. Filter the k-mer matrix

* _(optional)_ Remove k-mers belonging to a given collection of reference sequences
    + Run steps 1. and 2. with such a collection as input
    + Run `kmtools diff -k [kmer-size] -z [matrix_samples] [matrix_references]` <br/>(__Note__: the `-z` parameter is mandatory if the input matrix has been generated with kmtricks!)
* Retain only potentially differential k-mers with `kmtools filter -f 0.1 -F 0.1 [kmer_matrix]`

### 4. Build unitigs

* Output the filtered matrix in FASTA format with `kmtools fasta`
* Build unitigs (_e.g._, with GGCAT)
* Filter out short unitigs (_e.g._, shorter than 100 bp)

### 5. Build a unitig matrix

Run the command `kmtools unitig`, providing the unitig file generated in step #4 and the filtered matrix obtained from step #3.
The output will be a unitig matrix with the following format:
- the first colum represents the unitig identifier
- the other elements represent the average abundance and fraction of the unitig k-mers belonging to the sample (the two values are separated by a semicolon)
